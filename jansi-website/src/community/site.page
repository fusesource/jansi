  h1 How it works

  :markdown
  
    The *${project_name}* documentation and site is created using Scalate
    and is stored in git in the same [source control system as the
    code](source.html)

    **Note:** For code highlighting you will need to
    [install](http://pygments.org/download/)
    [http://pygments.org/](http://pygments.org).

  h1 Editing the source code

  :markdown
  
    If you [grab the source code](source.html) you will find the site
    source in the *${project_id}-website* directory.  The website is
    also built using Maven so, you would

        cd ${project_id}-website
        mvn package

    If you want to edit the files in your text editor and be able to
    immediately see the site re-rendered in a browser then use

        mvn jetty:run

    You can now surf the site and see changes immediately.

    If you are on OS X then we highly recommend
    [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) as a great editor which supports
    Textile and Markdown

  h1 Deploying the site
.right
  :markdown
  
#    The site is automatically deployed by the CI builds, so you can
#    simply wait for the changes to be automatically pushed to the project
#    site.
    
    The site is deployed through GitHub gh-pages branch: you can deploy the site using Maven:
    
        mvn install
