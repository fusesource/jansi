## Release Preparation Steps

Various documentation changes first (which should be done before the release is cut)

* edit the **${project_id}-website/ext/Website.scala** file and change the **project\_version** values
* blog about the release by creating an entry in **${project_id}-website/src/blog/releases** 
* update the changelog.md file, copying and pasting the section the release highlights from the above blog post

## Cutting the release 

* prepare the release

{pygmentize:: text}
mvn -P release release:prepare 
{pygmentize}

* perform the release

{pygmentize:: text}
mvn -P release release:perform
{pygmentize}

* open [Nexus Staging](http://repository.apache.org/index.html#staging)
  and close the staged release of #{project_name}
* now start a vote on the mailing lists and if it passes
* promote the closed release in nexus
* announce the release on the [mailing list](index.html)
* drink beers!
