  %h1 What is Jansi?
.right
  %p
    Jansi is a small java library that allows you to use ANSI escape sequences 
    to format your console output which works even on windows.  
  %p
    Using jansi is easy.  Before you start sending ANSI escape sequences to
    %code System.out
    make sure you run:
        
  :plain
    {coderay::java}
    AnsiConsole.systemInstall();
    {coderay}

  %p
    On Sun JVMs that should replace the System.out implementation, with an 
    the right ANSI aware implementation depending on your Platform.  If 
    you rather not mess with the System.out settings, you can use the
    %code AnsiConsole.out
    PrintStream instead.  For example:
    
  :plain
    {coderay::java}
    AnsiConsole.out.println("Hello World");
    {coderay}

  %h1 Windows Examples
.right
  %p
    Most unix terminals support rendering ANSI escape sequences when Java
    sends them via 
    %code System.out
    but when this is done on Windows, they don't get interpreted and you get
    garbage on the console similar to:
  %img.example{:src=>"images/before-windows.png"}
  
  %p
    If the application uses the jansi libary, things start to look
    much better:
  %img.example{:src=>"images/after-jansi-windows.png"}
        
  %p
    But wait, it gets better.  If you also add the JNA library to the 
    classpath, then jansi provides an even better ANSI handling implementation
    which use a few windows Native methods to properly apply color attributes
    and more precise cursor support.
