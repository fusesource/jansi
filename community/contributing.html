know</a> or raise a <a href="support.html">support request</a>.</p>

<p><a href="../download.html">Download</a> the code and try it out and see what you think.

<h2 id = "Improving_the_documentation">Improving the documentation</h2>

<p>Documentation is massively important to help users make the most of
Jansi and its probably the area that needs the most help!</p>

<p>So if you are interested in helping the documentation effort; whether its
just to fix a page here or there, correct a link or even write a tutorial
or improve what documentation is already there please do dive in and
help&#33;</p>

<p>All of the documentation is stored in project source repository, see <a href="site.html">How
the Site works</a></p>

<h2 id = "If_you_find_a_bug_or_problem">If you find a bug or problem</h2>

<p>Please raise a new issue in our <a href="https://github.com/fusesource/jansi/issues">Issue Tracker</a>. If
you can create a JUnit test case then your issue is more likely to be
resolved quicker. Then we can add your issue to our <a href="source.html">source control
system</a> and then we'll know when its really fixed and we can
ensure that the problem stays fixed in future releases.</p>

<h2 id = "Working_on_the_code_and_creating_patches">Working on the code and creating patches</h2>

<p>We gladly accept patches if you can find ways to improve, tune or fix
Jansi in some way.</p>

<h3 id = "Submitting&#95;patches">Submitting patches</h3>

<p>The easiest way to submit a patch is to create a new issue at our <a href="https://github.com/fusesource/jansi/issues">Issue
Tracker</a>, and provide a 
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests">Github pull request</a>
so that we can review it.</p>

<h2 id = "Becoming_a_committer">Becoming a committer</h2>
