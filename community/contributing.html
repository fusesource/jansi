<p>We really want you to get involved in the Jansi project, to
<a href="index.html">join the community</a> and help make it a better price of
software - please do dive in and help!</p>

<p>Try surf the <a href="../documentation/index.html">documentation</a> and website in
general - if somethings confusing or not clear, <a href="index.html">let us
know</a> or raise a <a href="support.html">support request</a>.</p>

<p><a href="../download.html">Download</a> the code and try it out and see what you think.
Browse the <a href="source.html">source code</a>. Got an itch to scratch, want to
tune some operation or add some feature?</p>

<p>Want to do some hacking on the Jansi code? Try surfing the our
<a href="" title="https://github.com/fusesource/jansi/issues">Issue Tracker</a> for open issues or features that
need to be implemented, take ownership of an issue and try fix it.</p>

<h2 id = "Improving_the_documentation">Improving the documentation</h2>

<p>Documentation is massively important to help users make the most of
Jansi and its probably the area that needs the most help!</p>

<p>So if you are interested in helping the documentation effort; whether its
just to fix a page here or there, correct a link or even write a tutorial
or improve what documentation is already there please do dive in and
help&#33;</p>

<p>All of the documentation is stored in project source repository, see <a href="site.html">How
the Site works</a></p>

<h2 id = "If_you_find_a_bug_or_problem">If you find a bug or problem</h2>

<p>Please raise a new issue in our <a href="https://github.com/fusesource/jansi/issues">Issue Tracker</a>. If
you can create a JUnit test case then your issue is more likely to be
resolved quicker. Then we can add your issue to our <a href="source.html">source control
system</a> and then we'll know when its really fixed and we can
ensure that the problem stays fixed in future releases.</p>

<h2 id = "Working_on_the_code_and_creating_patches">Working on the code and creating patches</h2>

<p>We gladly accept patches if you can find ways to improve, tune or fix
Jansi in some way.</p>

<p>We gladly accept patches if you can find ways to improve, tune or fix
Jansi in some way.</p>

<p>Most IDEs can create nice patches now very easily. e.g. in Eclipse just
right click on a file/directory and select <code>Team -&gt; Create Patch</code>. Then
just save the patch as a file and then submit it. (You may have to click
on <code>Team -&gt; Share...</code> first to enable the Subversion options).
Incidentally if you are an Eclipse user you should install the
<a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/">subclipse</a> plugin.</p>

<p>If you're a command line person try the following to create the patch</p>

<pre><code>diff -u Main.java.orig Main.java &gt;&gt; patchfile.txt</code></pre>

<p>or
    svn diff Main.java >> patchfile.txt</p>

<h3 id = "Submitting&#95;patches">Submitting patches</h3>

<p>The easiest way to submit a patch is to create a new issue at our <a href="https://github.com/fusesource/jansi/issues">Issue
Tracker</a>, attach the patch, tick the Patch
Attached button on the issue then fire off an email to the mailing
lists.</p>

<h2 id = "Becoming_a_committer">Becoming a committer</h2>

<p>Once you have made some good contributions you may be invited to become a
committer by the project team. We'll chat to you offline about it.</p>
